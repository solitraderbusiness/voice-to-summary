# Voice-to-Summary: Persian Financial Voice Report Bot

**Voice-to-Summary** is a Telegram bot and API that transcribes Persian financial market voice reports using OpenAI's Whisper API, summarizes them into ~200-word Persian summaries with emojis and Markdown formatting using OpenRouter's `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001` model, and stores data in a PostgreSQL database. It runs reliably under PM2 as `voice-to-summary` and supports Telegram channels for real-time financial updates.

The bot processes voice messages (e.g., 30 seconds to 12 minutes), ignores non-voice inputs, and delivers visually appealing summaries with actionable insights, making it ideal for financial analysts sharing market reports in Persian.

## Features

- **Summarization**: Generates ~200-word Persian summaries with emojis (üìà, ‚ö†Ô∏è, ‚úÖ) and MarkdownV2.
- **Database**: Stores transcripts and summaries in PostgreSQL for retrieval and export.
- **Telegram Integration**: Replies with summaries in channels or direct chats, ignoring text messages.
- **Concurrency**: Handles multiple voice messages sequentially with `asyncio.Lock` for stability.
- **Deployment**: Runs via PM2 for auto-restarts and reliability on low-resource servers (1GB RAM).
